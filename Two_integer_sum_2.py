'''
Brute Force Method
Check every pair of indices (i, j) to see if their sum equals the target. 
Return the first valid pair.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)

Space Complexity: O(1)

def twoSum(numbers, target):
    n = len(numbers)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target:
                return [i + 1, j + 1]  # 1-indexed

'''
Use two pointers (left and right) since the array is sorted. 
Move pointers inward based on the sum compared to the target.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
