'''
Optimal Method (BFS Iterative)
Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) with a queue to traverse the graph level by level. Clone nodes as you discover them and maintain a mapping from original to cloned nodes.

Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is vertices and E is edges (each node and edge visited once)

Space Complexity: O(V) for the hash map and queue
