Brute Force Method
Check every pair of elements to find the duplicate, or use a hash set to track seen elements.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) for nested loops, or O(n) with hash set

Space Complexity: O(1) for nested loops, or O(n) with hash set
def findDuplicate(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return num
        seen.add(num)

Optimal Method (Floyd's Cycle Detection - Tortoise and Hare)
Treat the array as a linked list where nums[i] points to index nums[i]. Since there's a duplicate, there must be a cycle. Use Floyd's algorithm to find the cycle, then find the entrance to the cycle (which is the duplicate number).

Time Complexity: O(n) (two phases of cycle detection)

Space Complexity: O(1) (only two pointer variables)
