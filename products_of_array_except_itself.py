Brute Force Method
For each index, compute the product of all elements except the one at that index by multiplying all other elements in a nested loop.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)

Space Complexity: O(n) (for the result array)
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    res = [1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        prod = 1
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                prod *= nums[j]
        res[i] = prod
    return res

'''
Optimal Method (Prefix and Suffix Products)
Calculate prefix and suffix products for each index and multiply them to get the result. This avoids division and ensures O(n) time.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) (for prefix, suffix, and result arrays)'''
class Solution:
