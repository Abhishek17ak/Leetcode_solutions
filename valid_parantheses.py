Brute Force Method
Repeatedly scan the string and remove any adjacent matching pairs of brackets ("()", "[]", "{}") until no more can be removed. If the string is empty at the end, it's valid.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) (since each scan can remove only one pair, and there can be up to n/2 scans)

Space Complexity: O(n) (for the intermediate string)

def isValid(s):
    prev = None
    while prev != s:
        prev = s
        s = s.replace("()", "").replace("[]", "").replace("{}", "")
    return s == ""

Optimal Method (Stack)
Use a stack to track opening brackets. For each closing bracket, 
check if the top of the stack is the matching opening bracket. 
If so, pop it; otherwise, return False. At the end, the stack should be empty.

Time Complexity: O(n) (each character is pushed/popped at most once)

Space Complexity: O(n) (stack can grow up to n/2 in the worst case)
